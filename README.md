Payment Integration System

A Spring Boot–based backend service for processing online payments through multiple providers (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, or mobile money).
The system exposes secure REST APIs for initiating, verifying, and tracking transactions.

Features

✅ Multi-provider support – Easily plug in different payment gateways.

🔐 Secure authentication – JWT-based security and encrypted storage of credentials.

📊 Transaction management – Create, verify, and query payment status.

🧩 Extensible design – Clean service and repository layers for adding new providers.

Tech Stack

Backend: Java 17, Spring Boot

Database: MySQL (JPA/Hibernate)

Build: Maven or Gradle

Deployment: Docker container (Heroku / Azure App Service)

CI/CD: GitHub Actions for automated build, test, and deployment

CI/CD

Build & Test: GitHub Actions compile code and run unit tests on every push.

Deployment: Docker image pushed to container registry and automatically deployed to Heroku or Azure staging, with promotion to production after health checks.

Rollback: Previous image tag or Heroku release used if a deployment fails.

Tips for Customizing

Replace <your-org> and placeholder environment variables with your actual values.

Add payment-provider–specific setup instructions (e.g., Stripe webhook secrets, PayPal sandbox).

If you maintain both backend and frontend, include instructions for running the frontend client.
